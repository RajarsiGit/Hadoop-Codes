For example, despite node 1's "central" position, it would not have succeeded in converting anyone at all to A were it not for the extremely low threshold on node 3.

It is also instructive to look at how the spread of A comes to a stop in Figure 4, and to ask whether the notion of clusters as obstacles to cascades can be extended to hold even in the case when thresholds are heterogeneous.
